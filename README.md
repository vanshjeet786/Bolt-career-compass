# Bolt-Career-Compass: Your Career's GPS, But Cooler

Ever felt like you're choosing a career path like you choose a show on Netflix? Scrolling endlessly, overwhelmed by options, and you just end up re-watching "The Office" for the 17th time? Yeah, we've been there.

**Bolt-Career-Compass** is here to be the "Chosen One" for your career path. It's not a magic 8-ball, but it's pretty close. This app is an AI-powered career assessment tool that helps you figure out what you should be when you grow up, even if you're already grown up.

## What is this sorcery?

This isn't your high school guidance counselor's dusty old questionnaire. We use a dash of AI magic and a pinch of data science to create a comprehensive, 6-layer assessment. Think of it like peeling an onion, but instead of crying, you get a cool new career.

We analyze:
- Your **Multiple Intelligences**: Are you a word-wizard like Shakespeare or a logic-lord like Spock?
- Your **Personality Traits**: Are you a Gryffindor, a Slytherin, or something in between? We'll help you figure out your work style.
- Your **Aptitudes & Skills**: What are you secretly awesome at? We'll find out.
- Your **Background & Environment**: Because where you're from matters. (Shoutout to all the Hobbits from the Shire!)
- Your **Interests & Values**: What really makes you tick? Is it money? Power? Or just a really good cup of coffee?
- **Self-Reflection & Synthesis**: We'll help you put it all together and create a master plan.

## Features that'll make you go "Whoa!"

- **AI-Powered Assessment**: Our AI is smarter than a fifth grader and (probably) won't ask to phone a friend.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: We'll give you career suggestions so tailored, you'll think we've been reading your diary.
- **24/7 AI Counselor**: Got a question at 3 AM? Our AI is always here for you, like a caffeinated, all-knowing owl.
- **Real-time Market Data**: Get the scoop on salaries, job outlooks, and whether your dream job is actually in demand.

## The Tech Stack: Powered by...

This project was built with a little bit of duct tape and a whole lot of love. Also, these things:

- **Frontend**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a lightning-fast experience.
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - because who has time for writing CSS from scratch?
- **Backend**: [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) - the cool, open-source alternative to Firebase. It handles our database, auth, and serverless functions.
- **AI**: We're using [Groq](https://groq.com/) to power our AI chat. It's so fast, it makes the Millennium Falcon look like a T-Rex on a tricycle.

## Getting Started: For the Adventurous Developer

So you want to peek behind the curtain? Or maybe you want to contribute (we'd love that!). Here's how to get this baby running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bolt-career-compass.git
    cd bolt-career-compass
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Supabase and Groq API keys. You can get these from the Supabase and Groq websites.
    ```
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
    GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Now you should be able to see the app running at `http://localhost:5173`.
